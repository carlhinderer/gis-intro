CHAPTER 1 - LEARNING GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------------------------

- History of Geospatial Analysis

    - 1832 - Charles Picquet tracks cholera outbreaks in Paris by plotting the homes of
               the patients on a map of the city.

    - 1854 - John Snow uses this method to track the source of a cholera outbreak in 
               London.

    - 1850-1870 - Charles Minard develops modern infographics.

    - Early 1900s - Map layers are created by putting different layers on different plates
                      of glass.


- GIS

    - Mid 1960s - Roger Tomlinson leads development of the Canada GIS.

    - Mid 1960s - Howard Fisher creates SYMAP GIS (GRID and Odyssey were successors)



- Remote Sensing

    - 'Remote sensing' is collecting information about an object without making physical
        contact with the object.  It also includes the processing of the collected data.

    - 1858 - The first aerial photograph is taken from a hot air balloon in Paris.

    - 1950s - American U-2 spy plane takes pictures from 75,000 feet

    - 1957 - USSR launches Sputnik 1

    - Early 1960s - USA's CORONA project takes first pictures from space

    - 1972 - NASA launches 'Landsat 1' to provide satellite photography to civilians

    - After 1972 - NOAA took over Lansat program, Landsat 8 was launched in 2013



- Elevation Data

    - Whereas remote sensing provides a 2D picture of the Earth, a 'DEM (Digital Elevation Model)' 
        is a 3D model of the planet's terrain.

    - 1986 - French space agency launches a satellite with stereoscopic radar and creates the
               first usable DEM.

    - 2000 - Space Shuttle Endeavour collected elevation data for 80% of Earth using a special
               radar antenna configuration.

    - 2009 - US and Japanese 'ASTER' project captures 99%, but has some data quality problems

    - 2014 - 2 German satellites work together to produce a global DEM called 'WorldDEM'



- CAD

    - Although Computer-Aided Drafting doesn't relate directly to geospatial analysis, their
        histories are intertwined.

    - Over time, the use cases for CAD and geospatial tools has started to overlap.



- The Importance of Geospatial Analysis

    - Geospatial analysis helps people make better decisions.  Tools have traditionally
        only been available only to governments and well-funded researchers, but 
        today anyone can access them.

    - Google Earth allows users to create 'KML (Keyhole Markup Language)' XML files
        to load and style data to the globe.

    - The 'OpenStreetMap' project is a crowd-sourced, worldwide, geographic base map
        that has most layers commonly found in a GIS.



- GIS Concepts

    - Thematic Maps

        - A 'thematic map' portrays a specific theme.  They are extremely useful and 
            influential in our society.

        - Thematic maps are models of reality, which means they depend on how the analyst
            analyzes and summarizes the data.  Two different analysts will often create
            very different maps.  We should not treat them as scientific evidence.

        - 'Spatial databases' aka 'geodatabases' are usually specialized software designed
            to extend a RDBMS.  Geometries can be queried using SQL.


    - Spatial Indexing

        - 'Spatial indexing' organizes geospatial vector data for faster retrieval.  It is
            a way of prefiltering the data for common queries or rendering.


    - Metadata

        - 'Geospatial metadata' is data about geospatial datasets that provides tracability for
            the source and history of a dataset.  It also provides long-term preservation of
            data by documenting the asset over time.

        - There are several standards for geospatial metadata, including:

            - 'ISO 19115-1' = add hundreds of fields to describe geospatial dataset
            - 'ISO 19115-2' = extensions for geospatial imagery and gridded data
            - 'ISO 19115-3' = describes procedure to generate an XML schema

        - The primary use of metadata is for cateloging datasets.  Modern metadata can be 
            ingested by geographic search engines, so it can be discovered automatically.
            It also lists points of contact for the dataset if you have any questions.

        - The 'OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)' created the 'CSW (Catalog Service for the Web)'
            to manage metadata.  The 'pycsw' Python library implements the CSW standard.


    - Map Projections

        - If you take any 3D object and flatten it on a plane, the object is distorted.  In 
            geospatial analysis, you can manipulate this distortion to preservce common
            properties, such as area, scale, bearing, distance, or shape.  

        - Projections are usually represented as a collection of fields in either XML or
           the 'WKT (Well-Known Text)' format.

        - The 'IOGP (International Association of Oil and Gas Producers)' maintains a registry
           of the most well-known projections.  The entries in the registry are known as
           'EPSG codes'.  

        - As recently as 15 years ago, there was no consistency in the projections that people
            used.  This meant that datasets became useless if projection information wasn't 
            included.  Also, layering maps on top of each other required re-projecting.  Newer
            projects such as 'OpenStreetMap' have consolidated much of the world in common
            projections.

        - 'Geodetic datums' are closely related to maps.  They are models of the Earth's surface
            used to match features of the Earth to a coordinate system.  'WGS 84' is a common
            datum, and is used by GPS.


    - Rendering

        - Geographic data includes points, lines, an polygons numerically as one or more points.

        - For remote sensing data, the challenge is typically the file size.  Images can be
            compressed using lossless or lossy compression algorithms.

        - Rendering an image on the screen can be computationally intensive.  Most remote sensing
            file formats allow for the storing of multiple lower-resolution versions of the
            images, called 'overviews' or 'pyramids'.  When we zoom out, a lower-resolution
            version of the image is displayed quickly and seemlessly.
