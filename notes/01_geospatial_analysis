- History of Geospatial Analysis

    - 1832 - Charles Picquet tracks cholera outbreaks in Paris by plotting the homes of
               the patients on a map of the city.

    - 1854 - John Snow uses this method to track the source of a cholera outbreak in 
               London.

    - 1850-1870 - Charles Minard develops modern infographics.

    - Early 1900s - Map layers are created by putting different layers on different plates
                      of glass.


- GIS

    - Mid 1960s - Roger Tomlinson leads development of the Canada GIS.

    - Mid 1960s - Howard Fisher creates SYMAP GIS (GRID and Odyssey were successors)
