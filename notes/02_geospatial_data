CHAPTER 2 - LEARNING GEOSPATIAL DATA
---------------------------------------------------------

- Common Data Formats

    - Until 2004, geospatial data was difficult to acquire and desktop processing power was limited.
        Preprocessing data was a requirement for any geospatial project.

      In 2004, Google released Google Maps, which upended the industry.  Other major players 
        released major advances this year also, including Microsoft (TerraServer), the OGC
        (Web Map Service), and Esri (ArcGIS 9).  These innovations were driven by Google Maps'
        map-tiling model, called 'slippy maps', which allowed for smooth, global, scrolling maps.


    - People had used map servers on the internet before Google Maps (MapQuest most notably), but
        they offered small amounts of data at a time over limited areas.  AJAX was the advance
        that made Google Maps so responsive and scalable.

      Also, Google Maps' JavaScript API made it possible for programmers to combine maps with data from 
        other sources to create mashups.


    - 'OpenLayers' is a standard for distributed geospatial layers.  It has now gone beyond Google's
        original API to offer additional features.

      'OpenStreetMap' is an open source answer to the tiled map services consumed by systems such as
        OpenLayers.  It has global, street-level vector data and other spacial features that have been
        collected from available governement data and many volunteers.  The data is maintained in a 
        Wiki-like fashion.


    - For many years, geospatial data was very difficult to obtain, and tools were used by governments
        or very large organizations only.  Web mapping has changed everything in the industry, and now
        anyone can build geospatial tools.


    - Another benefit of the web era is that data providers began distributing data in a common projection
        called 'Mercator'.  It's the same standard nautical navigation projection that was used 400 years ago.
        The Google variation is called 'Google Mercator'.  

      Mercator distorts the size of objects according to their distance from the equator.  It does preserve
        angles, which allows for plotting a course.

      Google also standardized on the 'WGS 84' datum, which defines a specific spherical model of the Earth
        called a 'geoid'.  This model defines the normal sea level.  Note that GPS also uses this model, so
        Google Maps is easily compatible with raw GIS data.


    - There are 2 primary categories under which most geospatial datasets can be grouped.

        1. Vector Data = Any format that minimally represents geolocation data using points, lines, or
                           polygons

        2. Raster Data = Any format that stores data in a grid of rows and columns.  Raster data includes all
                           image formats.



- Common Traits of Data Structures

    - There are 2 common factors in all geospatial data:

        1. Geolocation Data 

        2. Subject Information



- Understanding Spatial Indexing

    - Geospatial datasets are often very large files, easily reaching hundreds of MBs or even several
        GBs.  This can cause geospatial software to be quite slow in trying to do analysis.  Spatial indexes
        are created to mitigate this problem.

      The 'Quadtree Index' and 'R-tree Index' are the 2 most common spatial indexing algorithms.


    - Quadtree Index Algorithm

        A Quadtree is a tree in which each tree contains 4 children.  Each square is subdivided into 4 smaller
          squares.  When a node contains a specified number of features and more features are added, the node
          splits.

        Quadtree indexes are most commonly found in file-based index formats.


    - R-tree Index Algorithm

        R-tree indexes are more sophisticated than Quadtrees.  They are designed to handle 3D data and are
          optimized to store the index in a way that is compatible with the way databases use memory and
          disk space.

        Overlapping rectangles create bounding boxes for data. 


    - Grids

        Spatial indexes also often employ the concept of an integer grid.  Geospatial coordinates are
          usually floating point number with 2-16 decimal places.  However, integer comparisons are much
          cheaper than floating point comparisons.

        Most spatial indexing algorithms map floating-point coordinates to an integer grid to speed up 
          comparisons.

        Grid sizes can be as small as 256 x 256 for smaller file formats or can be as large as 
          3 million x 3 million in large geospatial databases.

        The technique used is very similar to the rendering technique we used in 'SimpleGIS' to convert
          latitude and longitude to screen pixels.
