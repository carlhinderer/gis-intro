CHAPTER 3 - THE GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE
---------------------------------------------------------


- The Geospatial Technology Landscape

    - Most geospatial software has 1 or more of these capabilities:

        1. Data Access
        2. Computational Geometry
        3. Image Processing
        4. Visualization Tools
        5. Metadata Tools



- Data Access

    - GDAL

        - Data access libraries such as GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) are mostly written in 
            C or C++ for speed and cross-platform compatability.  However, you will also see may packages
            written in Java.


        - The GDAL, GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source), and PROJ libraries are the workhorses of the
            geospatial analysis community.


        - GDAL was created by Frank Warmerdam in the late 1990s.  Combine GDAL with its sister library
            OGR for vector data, and you get the software with the greatest impact on geospatial software.
            GDAL has an MIT license, so it is both commercial- and open source-friendly.


        - GDAL provides a single, abstract model for the vast array of raster data types that are found
            in the geospatial industry.  It consolidates unique data access libraries for different formats.


        - In addition to raster data, GDAL supports 70+ vector data formats. GDL has these vecgtor capabilities:

            1. Uniform vector data and modeling abstraction
            2. Vector data reprojection
            3. Vector data format conversion
            4. Attribute data filtering
            5. Basic geometry filtering


        - The GDAL vector architecture has these components:

            1. Geometry = represents the OGC's 'Simple Features' specification data model for points, linestrings,
                            polygons, geometry collections, multipolygons, multipoints, and multilinestrings

            2. Feature Definition - attribute definitions of a group of related features

            3. Feature = ties Geometry and Feature Definition together

            4. Spatial Reference = contains an OGC spatial reference definition

            5. Layer = represents features grouped as layers in a data source

            6. Data Source = file or database object accessed by GDAL

            7. Drivers = translators for the 70+ data formats


    - Computational Geometry

        - Computational geometry encompasses the algorithms needed to perform operations on vector data.  


    - The PROJ Projection Library

        - The PROJ projection library was created by US Geological Survey Jerry Evenden in the mid 1990s.
            Since then, it has become part of OSGeo (Open Source Geospatial Foundation).
            
          It manages the huge task of transforming data among thousands of coordinate systems.  No other
            library comes close to its capability.


        - PROJ uses a simple syntax that is capable of describing any projection, including custom,
            localized ones.  PROJ can be found in virtually every major GIS package, providing reprojection
            support and command-line tools.


        - PROJ is available through GDAL for vector and raster data.  However, it is often useful to access
            the library directly, because it gives you the ability to reproject individual points instead
            of entire datasets.


    - CGAL

      - The CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library), originally released in the late 1990s,
          is a robust open source computational geometry library.  It was not specifically designed
          for geospatial analysis, but is widely used for the purpose.


      - CGAL is a source for reliable geometry processing algorithms.  


    - JTS

      - JTS is a computational geometry library written in pure Java.  It implements OGC Simple Features 
          specification for SQL.


    - GEOS

      - GEOS is the C++ port of JTS.  It ended up having a much larger impact on geospatial analysis than
          the original JTS.


      - GEOS can also be compiled with GDAL to use all of its capabilities.


    - PostGIS

      - PostGIS is the most commonly used open source spatial database.  It is essentially a module on top
          of PostgreSQL.  Much of its power comes from GEOS.  


      - Like JTS, PostGIS implements the OGC Simple Features specification for SQL.  PostGIS allows you
          to execute both attribute and spatial queries against a dataset.  


      - Here is an example:

          # Creates a 14.5-km buffer around Florida, showing the state's nautical boundary
          SELECT ST_BUFFER(the_geom, 145000)
          FROM usa_states
          WHERE state = 'Florida'


      - PostGIS has the following features:

          1. Geospatial geometry types
          2. Spatial functions for deriving new geometries
          3. Spatial measurements including perimeter, length, and area
          4. Spatial indexing using the R-tree algorithm
          5. A basic geospatial raster data type
          6. Topology data types
          7. US geocoder based on TIGER census data
          8. A new JSONB data type which allows querying of JSON and GeoJSON



    - Other Spatially Enabled Databases

        - Oracle Spatial and Graph

            Oracle Spatial and Graph provides spatial capabilities to Oracle databases.  It is used for
              analyzing networked datasets, like transportation, utilities, or social networks.


        - ArcSDE

             ArcSDE is Esri's spatial data engine.  It was a standalone product, but is now rolled into 
               ArcGIS.  It can support multiple different database backends.


        - Sql Server

            Microsoft added spatial support to SQL Server in 2008.  It supports types similar to PostGIS.
              It also supports the 'WKT' and 'WKB' formats.


        - MySQL

            MySQL provides support very similar to what Sql Server does.


        - SpatiaLite

            SpatiaLite is an extension to SQLite.


        - GeoPackage

            GeoPackage is a file-based geodatabase format.  It is an OGC specification created
              to replace the aging, close 'shapefile' format.
