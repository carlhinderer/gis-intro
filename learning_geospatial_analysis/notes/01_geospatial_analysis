CHAPTER 1 - LEARNING GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------------------------

- History of Geospatial Analysis

    - 1832 - Charles Picquet tracks cholera outbreaks in Paris by plotting the homes of
               the patients on a map of the city.

    - 1854 - John Snow uses this method to track the source of a cholera outbreak in 
               London.

    - 1850-1870 - Charles Minard develops modern infographics.

    - Early 1900s - Map layers are created by putting different layers on different plates
                      of glass.


- GIS

    - Mid 1960s - Roger Tomlinson leads development of the Canada GIS.

    - Mid 1960s - Howard Fisher creates SYMAP GIS (GRID and Odyssey were successors)



- Remote Sensing

    - 'Remote sensing' is collecting information about an object without making physical
        contact with the object.  It also includes the processing of the collected data.

    - 1858 - The first aerial photograph is taken from a hot air balloon in Paris.

    - 1950s - American U-2 spy plane takes pictures from 75,000 feet

    - 1957 - USSR launches Sputnik 1

    - Early 1960s - USA's CORONA project takes first pictures from space

    - 1972 - NASA launches 'Landsat 1' to provide satellite photography to civilians

    - After 1972 - NOAA took over Lansat program, Landsat 8 was launched in 2013



- Elevation Data

    - Whereas remote sensing provides a 2D picture of the Earth, a 'DEM (Digital Elevation Model)' 
        is a 3D model of the planet's terrain.

    - 1986 - French space agency launches a satellite with stereoscopic radar and creates the
               first usable DEM.

    - 2000 - Space Shuttle Endeavour collected elevation data for 80% of Earth using a special
               radar antenna configuration.

    - 2009 - US and Japanese 'ASTER' project captures 99%, but has some data quality problems

    - 2014 - 2 German satellites work together to produce a global DEM called 'WorldDEM'



- CAD

    - Although Computer-Aided Drafting doesn't relate directly to geospatial analysis, their
        histories are intertwined.

    - Over time, the use cases for CAD and geospatial tools has started to overlap.



- The Importance of Geospatial Analysis

    - Geospatial analysis helps people make better decisions.  Tools have traditionally
        only been available only to governments and well-funded researchers, but 
        today anyone can access them.

    - Google Earth allows users to create 'KML (Keyhole Markup Language)' XML files
        to load and style data to the globe.

    - The 'OpenStreetMap' project is a crowd-sourced, worldwide, geographic base map
        that has most layers commonly found in a GIS.



- GIS Concepts

    - Thematic Maps

        - A 'thematic map' portrays a specific theme.  They are extremely useful and 
            influential in our society.

        - Thematic maps are models of reality, which means they depend on how the analyst
            analyzes and summarizes the data.  Two different analysts will often create
            very different maps.  We should not treat them as scientific evidence.

        - 'Spatial databases' aka 'geodatabases' are usually specialized software designed
            to extend a RDBMS.  Geometries can be queried using SQL.


    - Spatial Indexing

        - 'Spatial indexing' organizes geospatial vector data for faster retrieval.  It is
            a way of prefiltering the data for common queries or rendering.


    - Metadata

        - 'Geospatial metadata' is data about geospatial datasets that provides tracability for
            the source and history of a dataset.  It also provides long-term preservation of
            data by documenting the asset over time.

        - There are several standards for geospatial metadata, including:

            - 'ISO 19115-1' = add hundreds of fields to describe geospatial dataset
            - 'ISO 19115-2' = extensions for geospatial imagery and gridded data
            - 'ISO 19115-3' = describes procedure to generate an XML schema

        - The primary use of metadata is for cateloging datasets.  Modern metadata can be 
            ingested by geographic search engines, so it can be discovered automatically.
            It also lists points of contact for the dataset if you have any questions.

        - The 'OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)' created the 'CSW (Catalog Service for the Web)'
            to manage metadata.  The 'pycsw' Python library implements the CSW standard.


    - Map Projections

        - If you take any 3D object and flatten it on a plane, the object is distorted.  In 
            geospatial analysis, you can manipulate this distortion to preservce common
            properties, such as area, scale, bearing, distance, or shape.  

        - Projections are usually represented as a collection of fields in either XML or
           the 'WKT (Well-Known Text)' format.

        - The 'IOGP (International Association of Oil and Gas Producers)' maintains a registry
           of the most well-known projections.  The entries in the registry are known as
           'EPSG codes'.  

        - As recently as 15 years ago, there was no consistency in the projections that people
            used.  This meant that datasets became useless if projection information wasn't 
            included.  Also, layering maps on top of each other required re-projecting.  Newer
            projects such as 'OpenStreetMap' have consolidated much of the world in common
            projections.

        - 'Geodetic datums' are closely related to maps.  They are models of the Earth's surface
            used to match features of the Earth to a coordinate system.  'WGS 84' is a common
            datum, and is used by GPS.


    - Rendering

        - Geographic data includes points, lines, an polygons numerically as one or more points.

        - For remote sensing data, the challenge is typically the file size.  Images can be
            compressed using lossless or lossy compression algorithms.

        - Rendering an image on the screen can be computationally intensive.  Most remote sensing
            file formats allow for the storing of multiple lower-resolution versions of the
            images, called 'overviews' or 'pyramids'.  When we zoom out, a lower-resolution
            version of the image is displayed quickly and seemlessly.



- Remote Sensing Concepts

    - Images as Data

        - Raster data is captured digitally as square tiles.  This means that the data is stored
            in a numerical array of rows and columns.  If the data is multispectral, the dataset
            will usually contain multiple arrays of the same size.  These different arrays are
            called 'bands'.

        - In geospatial analysis, it's important to think of images as a numeric array because
            mathematical formulas are used to process them.

        - In remotely sensed images, each pixel represents both space (the location on Earth of
            a certain size) and reflectance (captured as light reflected from the Earth at that
            location into space).  So, each pixel has a ground size and contains a number
            representing the intensity.


    - Remote Sensing and Color

        - Computer screens display images as a combination of Red, Green, and Blue.
            Satellites and other remote sensing imaging devices can capture light beyond this
            visible spectrum.  

        - On a computer, wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum are represented in the
            visible spectrum so that we can see them.  These images are known as 'false color'
            images.

        - For instance, in remote sensing, infrared light makes moisture highly visible.



- Vector GIS Concepts

    - Data Structures

        - GIS vector data has at least (x, y) values and often a z value as well.  Other
            ancillary values are possible, like a timestamp.

        - These coordinates are used to form points, lines, and polygons to make real-world
            objects.  Points can connect line segments.  Closed areas created by line
            segments are polygons.

        - Vector data typically represents topographic features better than raster data.  
            Vector data has more accuracy potential and is more precise.  However, collecting
            vector data on a large scale is traditionally costlier than raster data.

        - A 'bounding box' is the smallest possible square that contains all of the points in
            a dataset.  

        - A 'convex hull' is the smallest possible polygon that contains all the points in a 
            dataset.


    - Geospatial Rules About Polygons

        - Rules of Thumb:

            1. Polygons must have at least 4 points.
            2. A polygon boundary should not overlap itself.
            3. Polygons in a layer shouldn't overlap.
            4. A polygon in a layer inside another polygon is considered a hole in the
                 underlying polygon.

        - By definition, the first and last vertices of a polygon is identical.  Some
            geospatial software will throw an error if your first and last points don't
            match exactly.  Others will automatically close the polygon without complaining.


    - Buffer

        - A 'buffer' creates a polygon around another polygon at a specified distance.

        - Buffers are used for proximity analysis.  For example, establishing a safety zone
            around a dangerous area.


    - Dissolve

        - A 'dissolve' operation creates a single polygon out of adjacent polygons.  

        - A common use is to merge two adjacent properties in a tax database that has been
            purchased by a single owner.


    - Generalize

        - Objects that have more points than necessary for the geospatial model can be 
            'generalized' to reduce the number of points used to represent the shape.

        - Since computer screens have a resolution of 72 dpi (dots per inch), we can reduce
            the image down to this resolution, and it will be visually equivalent to the user.


    - Intersection

        - An 'intersection' operation is used to see if one part of a feature intersects
            with one or more features.  This operation is used for spatial queries in 
            proximity analysis.  

        - A 'merge' operation combines 2 or more non-overlapping shapes into a single
            multi-shape object.

        - A fundamental geospatial operation is checking to see whether a point is inside
            a polygon.  This operation is the building block of many different types of
            spatial queries.

          The most common and efficient algorithm to detect whether a point is inside a 
            polygon is called the 'ray casting algorithm'.  

            First, a test is performed to see if the point is on the boundary.  

            Next, it draws a line from the point in a single direction.  The program counts the
              number of times the line crosses the boundary until it reaches the bounding box
              limits.  If the number is odd, the point is inside.  If the number is even, the
              point is outside.


    - Union

        - The 'union' operation is useful when you want to combine 2 or more
            overlapping polygons in a single shape.  It is similar to dissolve, 
            but in this case the polygons are overlapping instead of adjacent.

        - Usually, this operation is used to clean up automatically generated feature
            datasets from remote sensing operations.


    - Join

        - A SQL join combines 2 or more tables.  In GIS, you can also have spatial joins
            that lets you combine attributes the same way, but based on proximity of
            features.

        - For instance, we could add the county name that each city resides in with a 
            spatial join from the county name to each city's attribute row.



- Raster Data Concepts

    - Band Math

        - 'Band math' is multidimensional array mathematics.


    - Change Detection

        - 'Change detection' is the process of taking 2 images of the same location at different
            times and highlighting those changes.  A change could be a new building or coastal
            erosion.


    - Histogram

        - A 'histogram' is the statistical distribution of values in a dataset.  The horizontal
            axis represents a unique value, and the vertical axis represents the frequency
            of the value.

        - A histogram is a key operation in most raster processing.  It can be used for everything
            from enhancing contrast in an image to serving as a basis for object classification
            and image comparison.


    - Feature Extraction

        - 'Feature extraction' is the manual or automatic digitization of features in an image to
            lines, points, or polygons.  This process serves as the basis for vectorization of 
            images in which a raster is converted to a vector dataset.

        - A common example is extracting a coastline from a satellite image and saving it as a
            vector dataset.  If this extraction is performed over several years, you could monitor
            the erosion or other changes along this coastline.


    - Supervised and Unsupervised Classification

        - Objects on the Earth reflect different wavelengths of light depending on the 
            materials they are made of.  In remote sensing, analysts collect wavelength
            signatures for specific types of land cover (ie concrete) and build a
            library for a specific area.  Then, they can predict the materials of other
            points.

        - In unsupervised classification, a computer groups pixels with similar reflectance
            values in an image without any other reference information besides the 
            histogram.


- Creating the Simplest Possible GIS

    - We will create a simple GIS in pure Python that shows 3 cities in Colorado.  The data
        model will be structured so that we can perform basic queries.


    - First, we'll need the 'turtle' module, which provides a very simple graphics engine
        based on Tkinter.  It should already be installed, but we can check:

        # Run the turtle demo script
        $ python -m turtle


    - The code has 2 different sections, the data model and the renderer.  For the data model,
        we will use simple lists.  The renderer uses turtle.
